Pinch
-----

Pinch is an arcade emulator launcher, but it can probably be made
to launch whatever
else<sup>[[citation needed]](http://xkcd.com/285/)</sup>.

It's written for the Raspberry Pi, although it should be portable
to any other Linux-based system that supports
OpenGL ES <sup>[[citation needed]](http://xkcd.com/285/)</sup>.

Its intended targets are arcade cabinets running Raspberry Pi.

It not yet complete.
