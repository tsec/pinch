Pinch
-----

Pinch is a launcher intended for launching emulated arcade titles,
but it can probably be made to launch whatever else.

It's specifically written for the Raspberry Pi, but it can probably
be migrated to any other Linux-based system that supports OpenGL ES.

The launcher is specifically intended to look minimalistic, as its
intended targets are arcade cabinets running Raspberry Pi.

It's currently **incomplete**.
